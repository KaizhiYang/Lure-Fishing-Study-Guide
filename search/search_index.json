Don\u2019t shake or twitch your lure too much. Hold the rod loosely. If you haven\u2019t had a bite for a while, try \u201cdeadsticking\u201d: leave the drop shot still, then reel in a few feet and stop again. Usually, you want to move the drop shot lightly on a slack line while keeping the weight on the bottom\u2014unless you are targeting fish you see suspended on your fishfinder.</p> <p>In colder months, it\u2019s even more important to slow down. Many anglers add a scent or color to the bait\u2019s belly or tail to attract fish while using slow or dead stick action. Don\u2019t just use a worm\u2014try other soft plastics like swimbaits, minnows, or small creature baits to get more bites.</p> <p>For craw-style baits, use a shorter leader to keep the bait near the bottom for a natural look. For swimbaits, you can drag the drop shot along the bottom to make the tail move more and attract fish.</p>"},{"location":"guide/drop_shot/drop_shot_beginner/#tips-tricks","title":"Tips &amp; Tricks","text":""}]}
