# How to Use This Guide

This guide includes:

- Basics: All the basic knowledge you may know before you start fishing.
- Fishing techniques: All the fishing techniques with two different levels (Beginner, Advanced).

---

## If you are a beginner
- Start with the [Basics](basics/tie_a_knot.md) section.
- After completing it, move on to the **Beginner** sub-sections under each technique. *I would suggest you start with [Drop Shot](drop_shot/drop_shot_beginner.md).*
- This path ensures you build a strong foundation before diving deeper.

---

## If you are at an intermediate level
- Skip or review the [Basics](basics/tie_a_knot.md) section selectively to fill in any knowledge gaps.  
- Begin learning any technique you may interested in.  
- Focus on areas that complement your current skills and expand your toolbox.
